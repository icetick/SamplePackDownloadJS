# JS list load
#Simple script to download multiple items from website (with stable ids)

Sometimes you want to download multiple files at once, but you don't have a possibility/link to 
download it with archieve.

#It's not a hack or grabbing, it just emulating real-world download, but without user interaction, so don't worry.

I know it's a pretty simple, so please don't throw the tomateoes.
It can be handy to someone.

Here is the website i write it for: https://www.models-resource.com/
I wanted to download several models at once (there is no possibility to do it on website because of it's nature)
